# Overview

This is a simple C# console To-Do app. You can create a todo list, add, remove, or complete a task. Your list will be displayed to the console. 

The purpose behind writing this software was for me to get more familiar with C#, before I will do a project with Unity game engine. I tried to learn basic syntax and OOP in C#.

# Development Environment

I've used Visual Studio for Mac. It is a little different from the tool I've used before. I couldn't figure out how to publish a GitHub repository from Visual Studio, so I did all of the version control using VS code. 

I used C# with standard libraries,=.
